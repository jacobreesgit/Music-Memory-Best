# Music Memory App - Implementation Notes

## Architecture Overview

This app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to maintain separation of concerns and facilitate testing:

- **Models**: Represent the data structures (Song)
- **Views**: UI layer built with SwiftUI
- **ViewModels**: Connect the data models to the views and handle presentation logic
- **Services**: Handle business logic and data operations

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Dependency Injection

The app uses a dependency injection container (`DIContainer`) to facilitate:
- Easy replacement of service implementations for testing
- Decoupling between components
- Centralized dependency management

### 2. Protocol-Based Service Layer

Services are defined by protocols to enable:
- Mock implementations for testing
- Future alternative implementations
- Clear contract definition

### 3. Actor for Music Library Service

The `MusicLibraryService` is implemented as an actor to ensure thread safety when accessing the music library.

```swift
actor MusicLibraryService: MusicLibraryServiceProtocol {
    // Implementation
}
```

This ensures that multiple concurrent accesses to the music library are properly synchronized.

### 4. Comprehensive Error Handling

The app uses a custom `AppError` enum with associated values to handle various error scenarios:
- Permission-related errors
- Media access errors
- Network errors
- Unknown errors

Each error includes user-friendly messages and recovery suggestions.

### 5. Permission Flow

The app implements a thorough permission flow:
1. Check current permission status on app launch
2. Present appropriate UI based on status (request, denied)
3. Provide guidance for users when permissions are denied
4. Handle permission changes during the app lifecycle

### 6. State Management

The app uses a combination of:
- Global app state via `AppState` for app-wide concerns
- ViewModel-specific state for view-related state
- `@Published` properties for reactive updates
- Proper loading states to handle asynchronous operations

### 7. Caching Strategy

The music library service implements a simple caching mechanism to avoid repeated fetches of the same data. The cache is invalidated when appropriate.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Persistence**: Add CoreData or another persistence solution to cache play counts locally
2. **Background Updates**: Implement background refresh for music library changes
3. **Filtering/Sorting Options**: Add additional filtering and sorting options
4. **Playback Integration**: Add the ability to play songs directly from the app
5. **Analytics**: Add analytics to track app usage and performance

## Testing Strategy

The app includes:
1. **Unit Tests**: For services and view models
2. **UI Tests**: For critical user flows
3. **Mock Implementations**: For services to facilitate isolated testing

## Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient Media Access**: The app accesses the media library efficiently to minimize battery impact
2. **Caching**: The app caches data to reduce repeated access to system APIs
3. **UI Performance**: The app uses lazy loading and efficient list rendering to ensure smooth scrolling

## Accessibility

The app supports:
1. **Dynamic Type**: All text respects the user's preferred text size
2. **Dark Mode**: The app adapts to the system appearance
3. **VoiceOver**: UI elements have appropriate accessibility labels
4. **Reduced Motion**: The app respects reduced motion settings
